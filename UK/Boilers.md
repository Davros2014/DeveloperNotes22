As a pensioner in the UK, you may be eligible for a free boiler grant through the government's Energy Company Obligation (ECO) scheme. This initiative aims to help low-income households improve energy efficiency by providing funding for boiler replacements and home insulation.

**Eligibility Criteria:**

- **Pension Credit:** **If** you receive Pension Credit (Guarantee Credit or Savings Credit), you're likely eligible for a boiler grant.

    to determine if you qualify.
    
2. **Apply Online:** Complete an application form through a service provider's website. You'll need to provide details about your current boiler, homeownership status, and the benefits you receive.
    
3. **Assessment:** If eligible, a registered installer will contact you to arrange a home survey, assessing your current boiler and determining the necessary work.
    
4. **Installation:** Once approved, a qualified engineer will replace your old boiler with a new, energy-efficient model. The cost is typically covered by the grant, though in some cases, a small contribution may be required.
