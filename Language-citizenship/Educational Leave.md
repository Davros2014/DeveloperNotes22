2. Record the days in HR: _Employees > Time management > Record attendances and absences > New > Educational leave_
3. Ask your manager to approve the days
4. Create a request 6 weeks before the course/training here: [HR4You - HRcontact Berlin](https://basf.service-now.com/esc?id=kb_article&sysparm_article=KB0065978&sysparm_language=en "https://basf.service-now.com/esc?id=kb_article&sysparm_article=kb0065978&sysparm_language=en") (add relevant info such as course, start and end date, also include that your manager approved the days in HR...)
5. A certificate of attendance must be submitted following the educational event - within four weeks after the end of the educational leave (ask the educational institution/company for this)
