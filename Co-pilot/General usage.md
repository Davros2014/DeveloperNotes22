#### Troubleshooting errors

###### Example use case:
I'm trying to install node modules for a Vue application. Normal case would be to cd into the specific directory and run "npm install" in the console/terminal. But instead I keep getting the following error message in the terminal;

`PS C:\Users\ArajarDW\Vue3\Vue3Assignments\composition-13-demo-starting-project> npm install
`npm warn EBADENGINE Unsupported engine {
`npm warn EBADENGINE   package: '@achrinza/node-ipc@9.2.2',
`npm warn EBADENGINE   required: { node: '8 || 10 || 12 || 14 || 16 || 17' },
`npm warn EBADENGINE   current: { node: 'v20.12.2', npm: '10.8.1' }
`npm warn EBADENGINE } 

Now, in this case I can probably figure out from the message what the issue is, but let's run it through the co-pilot chat feature to see what it says and what suggestions it gives for resolving the issue. Probably best to keep prompts fairly brief and add the specific information that applies to your current issue (also you can highlight the text or keep your cursor at the specific point in the file in question). You can always ask it to clarify later.

I'm trying to install npm modules for a Vue application but I get the following error message in the console:  { copy and paste the error message from above here }

###### Co-pilot response:
The error message you're encountering indicates that the `@achrinza/node-ipc@9.2.2` package does not support your current Node.js version (`v20.12.2`). The package specifies compatibility with Node.js versions 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, and 17, but you're using a newer version that is not listed as compatible.

To resolve this issue, you have a few options:

1. **Downgrade Node.js**: You can downgrade your Node.js to one of the versions supported by `@achrinza/node-ipc` (e.g., 17, 16, 14). This can be done using a version manager for Node.js such as `nvm` (Node Version Manager) for Linux/macOS or `nvm-windows` for Windows.
    
2. **Use `--force` or `--legacy-peer-deps`**: If downgrading Node.js is not an option, you can try installing the npm modules using the `--force` flag or the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag to bypass the engine check. However, this might lead to unexpected behavior if `@achrinza/node-ipc` is not compatible with Node.js v20.12.2.
    
3. **Check for an updated version of `@achrinza/node-ipc`**: It's also a good idea to check if there's a newer version of `@achrinza/node-ipc` that supports Node.js v20.12.2. You can check this on the npm website or by running `npm view @achrinza/node-ipc versions`.
    
4. **Contact the package maintainer**: If no newer version exists that supports Node.js v20.12.2, consider contacting the maintainer of `@achrinza/node-ipc` to inquire about future support for newer Node.js versions.
    

Here's how you can downgrade Node.js using `nvm-windows` as an example:

1. Install `nvm-windows` from its GitHub releases page.
2. Open a new terminal and run `nvm install 16.13.0` to install Node.js version 16.13.0.
3. Then, switch to this version by running `nvm use 16.13.0`.
4. Try running `npm install` again in your project directory.

Remember to replace `16.13.0` with the version of Node.js that best suits your needs and is compatible with the rest of your project dependencies.

As I thought, it's likely just an issue with the version of Node I have installed and I should downgrade/switch to an older version in order to get them to install. But it gives specific instructions on how to achieve this and also other potential resolutions should that not be the case. I would argue it's much more intuitive to use and negates the need to search the internet.

But looking at the info it provided - I see Step.1 above is a bit vague - how do I install nvm windows, this in itself involves me having to step out of the IDE to check for a link and or instructions? I'll ask co-pilot to elaborate and because it's conversational it remembers the context of the previous exchange - another bonus over googling the answer 

###### My prompt: 
How exactly do I install nvm-windows?

###### Co-pilot response:
To install `nvm-windows`, a Node Version Manager for Windows, follow these steps:

1. **Download the Installer**:
    
    - Visit the `nvm-windows` releases page on GitHub (`https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases`).
    - Look for the latest release and download the `nvm-setup.zip` file.
2. **Extract and Run the Installer**:
    
    - Extract the `nvm-setup.zip` file.
    - Run the `nvm-setup.exe` file from the extracted folder to start the installation wizard.
3. **Follow the Installation Wizard**:
    
    - The installer will guide you through the setup process. Accept the license agreement, choose the installation folder, and proceed with the installation.
4. **Verify Installation**:
    
    - Open a new command prompt or PowerShell window.
    - Type `nvm version` to check if `nvm-windows` is installed correctly. It should display the version of `nvm-windows` if the installation was successful.
5. **Using `nvm-windows`**:
    
    - To install a specific version of Node.js, use the command `nvm install <version>`, replacing `<version>` with the version number of Node.js you wish to install. For example, `nvm install 14.17.0`.
    - To switch between installed Node.js versions, use `nvm use <version>`.
    - To list all installed Node.js versions, use `nvm list`.

Remember, after installing a new version of Node.js with `nvm`, you might need to reopen your command prompt or PowerShell window to use the newly installed version.

And there it provides specific instructions on how to resolve the issue and how to roll it back to the current version should I encounter the issue in reverse. Maybe not the most complex of examples but it gives you an idea of how to structure prompting and what to do with the results of this. I find it very useful. 

I had another case recently whereby in the tutorial I was following the syntax worked for the person in the video. Mine did not work. I followed the code exactly, however the linter in the IDE kept throwing errors and the console kept telling I can't do use xxx (it was in relation to state management in Vue). After prompting co-pilot, it suggested that whilst my syntax was accurate, probably the video was older than the Vue version the course had suggested to use, and since the syntax has changed. I changed the syntax, only slightly but enough so that it worked and I could move on. A very small issue but I could have been stuck there a while - sure I could have copy/pasted the issue into google and eventually found other user cases experiencing the same but likely would have taken longer, in this way it provides a much smoother and integrated development experience. At least this is what I have found it to be thus far.
