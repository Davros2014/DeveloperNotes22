## Performance efficiency
---
### Time behaviour
What practices/optimal measures can increase the performance rate? 

### Resource utilization
Not sure on this

### Capacity
How acheivable is it for larger numbers of users to be working concurrently without performance being affected? 


## Compatibility
---
### Co-existence
How compatible is the platform, out of the box, with other products - what are the potential issues or impacts on user experience or performace. 

### Interoperability
How easily can information be shared/consumed from other platforms or apis (M365, API (Sinequa), Webanayltics)


## Usability
---
### Appropriateness recognizability
How intuitive is the system to use, what is the learning curve, 

### Learnability
What is the learning curve for understanding the system as a developer or editor - do they have adequate documentation or training available?

### Operability
What would you define as being the key features that seperate your platform from others in terms of how you build and control your applications?

### User error protection
What safe guards are in place to stop uneccesary deletion of files, are there auto-saves in place, does the system integrate with any particular version control system.

### User interface aesthetics


### Accessibility
Is the system tailored for users of specific disabilities, hard of sight etc - can font-size/colours be easily adapted for specific users needs?


## Reliability
---
### Maturity
How adaptable is you system, can you point to exampls of how your system has matured and adapted to changin gtechnologies.

### Availability


### Fault tolerance
What measures do you have for software backup? Do you have measures to inform the user of any issues that that are not directly related to the system (issues with cloud access/server loss) and to reassurethat their data is secure?
