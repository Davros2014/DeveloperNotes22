### Questions for Magnolia

Do you have up to date training available through the Magnolia Academy, there isn't much available online beyond versions 4 & 5, and without access to the MA, it's hard to assess, could you elaborate on what is officially available and/or point us towards recommended learning/training?

To what extent is the product capable of utilising other libraries/frameworks? (react/angular etc).

Is the product capable of using other current/emerging technologies for front-end development? (ie preprocessors such as sass/less or styled components if React based or Typescript for example)
