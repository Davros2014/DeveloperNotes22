## Styling

##### Branding (Theme & Styleguide)
https://support.staffbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4410307430034-Custom-Branding-of-Your-Staffbase-Platform-With-CSS-

Custom CSS can break your theme or cause certain elements to display incorrectly if it is not implemented correctly. Only use custom CSS if you have experience and always double-check how your app looks after applying your styles. Changes to CSS styles should be handled with caution and should be only done by advanced users like web developers or web designers.
