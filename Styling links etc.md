Link to CSS files (do not edit any files directly - contact myself, Amir for review first) - `external\htmlroot\css\BASF_darkblue`

Link to the design system (very much work still in progress) - `https://gbs-dev.basf.net/?rq_MenuGuid=4F2EAC4D9CA02BE7A43CA651AD24922F2DD17DFD&rq_TemplateKey=7374616765`

We had icons coming from 4 different css sources, plus the use of png files. These have now been standardised and we solely use font awesome, with a few exceptions. 

Link to Icons - you can click on any of the icons and it will copy "Icon IconClassName" to the clipboard - add these classes to the styles section of the text/header in question. If there are any png files used as icons these should be replaced by their css equivalent, we can get on a call if you have any issues implementing this - `https://gbs-dev.basf.net/?rq_AppGuid=5C1A13C6D04388AE819D7AD35BAAF3A0038E2003&rq_TargetPageGuid=C01389EA5B1D3E0133E6A2DB967DEA79EC91E55D&qs_link=7D5958E29833E5CF62816F40A0687A1137C4B817&rq_TemplateKey=7374616765`

Link to deprecated styles - `@import url(../../deprecationSupport.css)` in the application Edit user defined styles. and the path should be "../../deprecationSupport.css"
File is located at `external/htmlroot/css/deprecationSupport.css`

Some of the older styles that we will eventually phase out but are included here as replacing everything is too time consuming
